## What is Linux?

**Linux** is a family of open-source, Unix-like operating systems built on the Linux kernel. It powers servers, desktops, embedded devices, and much of the internet’s infrastructure. It’s known for its stability, security, flexibility, and strong open-source ecosystem.


## Common Linux Distributions

A **distribution** packages the Linux kernel with other software to form a complete operating system. Popular distributions:

- **Ubuntu / Linux Mint:** Beginner-friendly, large user communities.
- **Debian:** Stable and well-tested.
- **Fedora:** Cutting-edge software from the open-source community.
- **Arch Linux:** Rolling release, minimal by default, for advanced users.


## Getting Started

### Accessing Linux

- **Install on Your Machine**
- **Live USB** for testing
- **Virtual Machine (VirtualBox, VMware)**
- **Cloud Instances (AWS, GCP, Azure)**

### Using a Terminal

Open a terminal to run commands. On Ubuntu, `Ctrl+Alt+T` often opens it. The terminal, or shell, is powerful for managing systems, automating tasks, and troubleshooting.

## File System Basics

The Linux filesystem starts at `/` (root):

- `/home` for user directories  
- `/etc` for configuration files  
- `/bin`, `/usr/bin` for system and user executables  
- `/var` for variable data (logs, caches)  
- `/tmp` for temporary files  
- `/dev` for devices

## Working with Directories and Files

- `ls`, `cd`, `pwd` for navigation
- `mkdir`, `rmdir` for directories
- `cp`, `mv`, `rm` for file manipulation
- Use tab-completion for convenience

## Viewing and Editing Text Files

- `cat`, `less`, `head`, `tail` for viewing
- `nano`, `vim` for editing in terminal
- `gedit`, `kate` for GUI editing

## Permissions and Ownership

Each file has an owner, group, and permissions.  
Use `chmod` to change permissions, `chown` to change ownership.

**Security Best Practice:**  
**Use restrictive permissions by default.** For example, set newly created files or scripts to not be executable unless necessary and avoid giving write permissions to others. This helps prevent unauthorized modifications and reduces attack surfaces.

## Installing and Managing Software

Most distros have package managers:

- **Debian/Ubuntu/Mint:** `sudo apt update && sudo apt install package-name`
- **Fedora/RHEL/CentOS:** `sudo dnf install package-name`
- **Arch Linux:** `sudo pacman -S package-name`

**Package Signing and Verification:**  
Packages in official repositories are usually signed. When installing software, always prefer official or well-known repositories. Use `apt-key`, `rpm --checksig`, or GPG to verify that the software comes from a trusted source.

## Systemd and Service Management

Modern Linux systems use **systemd** to manage services, daemons, and the boot process:

- `systemctl status service-name` to check service status  
- `systemctl start service-name` to start a service  
- `systemctl enable service-name` to enable a service at boot  
- `systemctl stop`, `systemctl restart` likewise for stopping/restarting

Understanding systemd is crucial for modern Linux administration, as it controls how services run and interact with each other.

## System Monitoring and Networking

- **Process Monitoring:**  
  - `top` or `htop` for real-time process info  
  - `ps aux` for snapshot of running processes  
  - `kill <PID>` to terminate a process

- **Disk & Memory Usage:**  
  - `df -h` for disk usage  
  - `du -h folder/` for directory size  
  - `free -h` for memory usage

- **Networking:**
  - `ip addr` to view network interfaces  
  - `ping` to test connectivity  
  - **Tools for Networking Security and Debugging:**  
    - `netstat` or `ss` to view network connections and listening ports  
    - `nmap` to scan for open ports and services on a network (use responsibly!)

## Security and Privacy Considerations

Security is a fundamental aspect of system administration. Here are essential tools and concepts:

- **Firewalls:**
  - `ufw` (Uncomplicated Firewall) on Ubuntu-based systems: `sudo ufw enable`, `sudo ufw allow 22/tcp`  
  - `firewall-cmd` (Fedora/CentOS/RHEL): `sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=http --permanent` followed by `sudo firewall-cmd --reload`

- **Logging and Auditing:**
  - `journalctl` to view systemd’s journal logs: `journalctl -xe` for recent errors.  
  Review logs regularly for suspicious activity.

- **Intrusion Detection:**
  - Tools like `fail2ban` can monitor log files and block suspicious IPs  
  - Consider using SELinux or AppArmor for mandatory access controls.

- **Disk Encryption and Secure Boot:**
  - **Disk Encryption:** Use **LUKS** (Linux Unified Key Setup) to encrypt your partitions. This ensures that data at rest is protected if the device is lost or stolen.  
  - **Secure Boot:** Modern systems can leverage UEFI Secure Boot to ensure that only signed boot loaders and kernels run on your machine, adding a layer of protection against tampering.

**Best Practices:**
- Keep your system updated (`sudo apt upgrade`, `sudo dnf upgrade`)
- Use strong, unique passwords or SSH keys
- Limit the use of `sudo` and run software as a non-root user whenever possible

  - [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/)  
  - [Ubuntu Documentation](https://help.ubuntu.com/)  
  - Community forums: [Ask Ubuntu](https://askubuntu.com/), [LinuxQuestions.org](https://www.linuxquestions.org/)


## Open Source Principles and Software Verification

Linux and its ecosystem are built on open-source principles. This means you can:

- Use, study, modify, and redistribute the software freely.
- Rely on strong communities and transparent code review.

**FOSS Alternatives:**  
Instead of proprietary software, consider using:
- **LibreOffice** as an alternative to Microsoft Office  
- **GIMP** as an alternative to Adobe Photoshop  
- **Inkscape** as a vector graphics editor instead of Adobe Illustrator

**Software Verification:**
- Always install from official repositories or verified sources.
- Check package signatures (`gpg --verify`), use official keys and repositories. Avoid random .deb or .rpm files from unknown websites.
